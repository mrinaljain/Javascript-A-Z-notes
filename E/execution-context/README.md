# Execution Context

Everything in Javascript happens inside Execution context.
- Memory Component ( used for memory allocation)
- Code Component ( used for code execution )

So basically execution context decides kab kya execute hoga aur iske andar hi execute hota hai synchronously in asingle thread.

Synchronous  = Ek cretain order mai / Ek k baad ek
Songle threaded = One at a time / Ek time pr ekk hi execute hoga
