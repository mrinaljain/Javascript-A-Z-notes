**ES8 (ECMAScript 2017)**:

  - **`async`/`await`**: Introduced as a cleaner way to handle asynchronous code by using promises in a more synchronous-like manner. It improves code readability and reduces callback hell.

  - **Object.entries() and Object.values()**: These methods provide an easy way to iterate over the properties and values of an object. `Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs, while `Object.values()` returns an array of values.

  - **String padding methods (`padStart()` and `padEnd()`)**: These methods allow you to pad the beginning or the end of a string with specified characters to ensure a specific string length.
  
  - **Shared memory and atomics**: Introduced shared memory for use with Web Workers and atomics for controlling concurrent access to memory.
