**ES7 (ECMAScript 2016)**:
  - **Exponentiation Operator (`**`)**: The exponentiation operator (`**`) was introduced to replace `Math.pow()`. It allows you to raise numbers to a power more easily.
  - **Array.prototype.includes**: A new method for arrays to check if an element exists in the array. It is more readable than `indexOf()`.
