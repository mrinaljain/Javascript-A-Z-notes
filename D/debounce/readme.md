methods for ratelimiting 
- scrolling
- clicks
- search 
etc


# Debouncing
 It ensures that the function only runs after a specified delay has passed since the last time it was called
 
 Example search : kitna bhi type kr lo, search API har type pr nhi  call hogi  but certain time intervale pr hogi


# Throttling
Controls the frequency of function execution by ensuring it only runs once every specified period

Throtling  ensures ki if you are  clicking on a button 10 times , it will limit the click event and only allow the click event after that time intervel has passed.
