# Debouncing
 It ensures that the function only runs after a specified delay has passed since the last time it was called

 Debouncing is a technique to delay the execution of a function until a specified time has passed since the last call.

 *It's useful when you want to limit the rate at which a function is invoked, like when handling user input events (e.g., typing in a text box) or scrolling.

 Example search : kitna bhi type kr lo, search API har type pr nhi  call hogi  but certain time intervale pr hogi
   methods for ratelimiting 
   - scrolling
   - clicks
   - search 
   etc
